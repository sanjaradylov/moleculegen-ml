"""
Build callback objects to run during model training.

Classes
-------
Callback
    Callback ABC.
CallbackList
    Perform callbacks sequentially and log output messages.

BatchMetricScorer
    Calculate and log metrics after batch sampling and forward computation.
EarlyStopping
    Stop training when a monitored evaluation function has stopped improving.
EpochMetricScorer
    Calculate and log metrics at the end of every epoch.
Generator
    Generate, save, and optionally evaluate new compounds.
ProgressBar
    Print progress bar every epoch of model training.
